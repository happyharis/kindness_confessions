This project is actually inspired by this trend that is most commonly seen in schools and institutions, such as SP confessions, TP confessions and so forth. I feel that people like to read people confessions on something, anonymously, on the web as it gives a space for them to reflect and write down their thoughts. 

And I was thinking, why does no one confess on something like an act of kindness?

Thus, I tried to do a mini project called the kindness confessions.
